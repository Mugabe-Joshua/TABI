    <h2>How does code move using Git</h2>
        <p>Code lives in 4 areas:<br>
            1. The working directory
            2. The Index
            3. The Local repo
            4. The Remote repo
        </p>
    <h3>The working directory:</h3>
        <p>
            This is where you make changes directly to local code.<br>
            Imagine it as the creation point.
        </p>
    <h3>The Index:</h3>
        <p>
            This is where changes are added for the next commit.<br>
            Imagine it as the bridge between the working directory and the local repo.
        </p>
    <h3>The local repo:</h3>
        <p>
            This is where commits of code are tracked by Git for security purposes. However this is done locally.<br>
            Imagine this as the introvert twin.
        </p>
    <h3>The remote repo:</h3>
        <p>
            This is where code can be pushed for collaborating with other developers and are tracked by Git. This is done online.<br>
            Imagine this as the extrovert twin.<BR>
        <b>NB:</b><BR>
            When pushing local changes to a remote repo for the first time, we use the command (git push --set-upstream origin master) so as to inform the introvert twin that it can share its stories with its extrovert twin only.
        </P>
    <h2>CLONING A REMOTE REPO</h2>
        <p>
            Use the command(git clone "repo_URL")
            We can decide to create a branch other than the default master branch using the git command(git checkout -b "new_branch_name")
        </p>
